or something bad's happened already

Found the right door obviously  
How did you find it?  
Simple, i went deep  
Deep. like old?  
No, deep like, crap you do not want to think about so you bury it, you shove other crap over it and you dont go there, ever.

Way out was through your worst memory

You did what you had to do. This is where you learn that they pretty much never say thanks when you save them.

You got the only genetic case of bullt-in-the-brain i've ever seen.

everything else melted by that bullet, gone.

last memory huh? glad i saved the best for last.

You cant torture someone who has nothing left for you to take away.

This is where they bring their bodies to be fixed. they consider it a safe place. but the truth is often they actually die here instead and they never question it.

Whatever you're looking for you might not like what you find.

I'm so sorry  
Not as sorry as you're gonna be.

I'm your new god, better one.

We need you to kill god  
Pardon?  
Kill god. You heard right, your honor

God? You look awfully like a mutated angel to me

The Leviathans. Long before god created angel or man, he made the first beasts.   
Why do you think he created purgatory? To keep those clever, poisonous things out.

It's just my brain leaking memories from the cage.

of course there isnt one heaven. each soul generates its own paradise.

It's simple. Freedom is a length of rope. god wants you to hang yourself with it.

Explaining freedom to angels is a bit like teaching poetry to fish.

They're soldiers. They werent built for freedom. They were built to follow.

Lucifer was petulant child with daddy issues

i dont understand how a guy like this can turn into that monster?  
spirits like Greeley are, like wounded animals. lost. in so much pain that they lash out.   
why why are they here?  
well, there's some part of them that's keeping them here. like their remains, or unfinished business. it could be revenge. it could be love or hate. whatever it is, they jsut hold on too tight. cant let go. so they're trapped. caught in the same loops. replaying the same tragedies over and over.  
you sound almost sorry for them  
they werent evil people. you know, a lot of them were good. just something happened to them. something they couldnt control.
