Used to be i'd hide in the woods for days, weeks whispering to people. trying to draw them out into the night. but they had community. they all looked out after each other. i'd be lucky to eat maybe one, two souls a year. but now when i'm hungry, i simply make a phone call. you're all so connected, but you've never been so alone.

- Times have changed.
- Ha. Tell me about it. All of a sudden, this Jesus character's the hot, new thing in town. All of a sudden our altars are being burned down and we're being hunted down like common monsters
- But did we say peep? Oh, no no no, we did not. We kept a low profile, we got jobs, a mortgage. We... What was that word, dear?
- We assimilated.

i dont understand how a guy like this can turn into that monster?  
spirits like Greeley are, like wounded animals. lost. in so much pain that they lash out.   
why why are they here?  
well, there's some part of them that's keeping them here. like their remains, or unfinished business. it could be revenge. it could be love or hate. whatever it is, they jsut hold on too tight. cant let go. so they're trapped. caught in the same loops. replaying the same tragedies over and over.  
you sound almost sorry for them  
they werent evil people. you know, a lot of them were good. just something happened to them. something they couldnt control.
