I feel like I'm not from humankind down there  
I feel like glaciers are my eyes  
And mountains are my head, my heart is ocean  
And I feel all alone  
'Cause everybody's wrong, I fear the living  
What is this thing that we call hate?  
And that's inside of me, get out of here

But why do you say that you are lost  
If you don't even try to find yourself?
