- T4g instances are designed for applications that donâ€™t use CPU at full power most of the time

## If you cannot delete Elasticbeanstalk environment

You need to go to your CloudFormation console and retry deletion of the CloudFormation stack which the Beanstalk  
environment used. The deletion may fail, but after retrying it will prompt you if you want to skip the  
"AWSEBRDSDatabase" resource that failed to delete. You can just confirm that you want to skip deletion (since you have  
actually already deleted it). This should remove the CloudFormation stack. Then you can retry deletion of the Beanstalk  
environment from the Beanstalk console.
